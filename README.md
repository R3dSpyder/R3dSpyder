👋 Hi, I’m @R3dSpyder 👋 

I'm a UK computer science teacher (GCSE and A-level) and a qualified children's ICU nurse (still working the occasional bank shift).
I am experienced in programming and algorithm implementation, but now I wish to become a software developer and enter industry for better prospects.

💞️ I’m interested in algorithms, encryption, web development, game development, sockets and networking, cyber security and AI/machine learning.

👀  

I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects related to my interests that are intermetiate in complexity and have supportive teams.
Due to my background, I am also willing to collaberate on projects related to education or led by pupils, and any applications related to healthcare.
