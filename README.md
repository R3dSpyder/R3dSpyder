👋 Hi, I’m @R3dSpyder 👋 

I'm a UK computer science teacher (GCSE and A-level) and a qualified children's ICU nurse (still working the occasional bank shift).

I am experienced in programming and algorithm implementation, but now I wish to become a software developer and enter industry for better prospects.

💞️ I’m interested in algorithms, encryption, web development, game development, sockets and networking, cyber security and AI/machine learning. 

..:: I am proficient with Python, C#, Java, switft, SQL databases and Javascript (with HTML and CSS). I can utilise Unity game engine, React and a variety of Anaconda packages such as numpy, matplotlib etc. I can write web crawlers and build simple GUI, I can use sockets and implement networking features and I can write algorithms for search and sort, pathfinding, and basic machine learning::..


👀  
I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects related to my interests above that are intermetiate in complexity and have supportive teams.
Due to my background, I am also willing to collaberate on additional projects that can utilise my existing skills such as those related to the provision of education in schools, any projects designed for -or lead by pupils (adult or child) trying to learn concepts/languages/frameworks, and of course any project related to healthcare provision or diagnostics.
